colorspiral README

colorspiral is code to define a spiral in HSV colour space, and select 
colours along that spiral. The idea is that such colours will be - for
small numbers of colours - particularly distinguishable from each other.
Where large numbers of colours are chosen, it can help to use a 
brightness jitter.

This code is intended ultimately to be contributed to Biopython
(http://biopython.org) as Bio.Graphics.ColorSpiral, but is 
being provided as early release to accompany a blog post at
